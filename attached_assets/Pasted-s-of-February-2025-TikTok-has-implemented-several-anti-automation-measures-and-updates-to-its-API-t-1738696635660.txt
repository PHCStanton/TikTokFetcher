s of February 2025, TikTok has implemented several anti-automation measures and updates to its API to enhance security and user data protection. Here are the key points regarding these measures:

## Recent Anti-Automation Measures

1. **Enhanced Automated Moderation**:
   - TikTok has significantly increased its use of automated moderation technologies. As of 2024, automation is responsible for over **80% of video removals**, up from 62% the previous year. This proactive approach allows TikTok to identify and remove violative content before it reaches users, improving their content moderation efficiency to a **98.2% proactive detection rate** [3][4].

2. **Account and Content Restrictions**:
   - The platform has been actively banning accounts that violate community guidelines, particularly those suspected of being underage or engaging in automated behaviors. In 2024 alone, over **20 million accounts** were removed globally for being thought to belong to users under the age of 13 [3]. This indicates a strict stance against inauthentic engagement on the platform.

3. **API Limitations**:
   - TikTok's API has undergone changes that restrict bulk downloading and automated interactions with user content. These restrictions are likely designed to prevent unauthorized scraping or downloading of videos, which could compromise user privacy and data security.

4. **Legal and Regulatory Pressure**:
   - The ongoing scrutiny from various governments, particularly in the U.S., has led TikTok to adopt more stringent data protection measures. The company is required to comply with national security laws that mandate transparency regarding data handling practices [2][4]. 

5. **User Data Protection Initiatives**:
   - TikTok has invested significantly in trust and safety initiatives, committing over **$2 billion** in 2024 alone to enhance its safety protocols and ensure compliance with international regulations regarding user data [4][5]. 

n summary, TikTok's recent updates reflect a robust response to concerns about automation, user privacy, and content moderation. The platform's increased reliance on automated systems for content management, combined with stricter API rules and regulatory compliance efforts, indicates a comprehensive approach to mitigating risks associated with unauthorized automation and data misuse. For developers working with TikTok's API, staying current with these changes is crucial for maintaining compliance and ensuring effective application functionality.
